                  Fughesi Ink wants you to enjoy the feel and fit of the shirts
                  that you purchase, and so with quality in mind we decided to
                  stock two different brands of shirts to accommodate everyone's
                  style and budget!

                  The Concert Tee will be your more budget option with a more
                  relaxed fit while maintaining a super soft, yet traditional
                  cotton feel. The Unisex Triblend comes in as the more premium
                  shirt with exceptional softness and a tappered fit. This shirt
                  leverages the stretch of polyesther, the traditional comfort
                  of cotton and the smoothness of Rayon (synthetic silk).

            The inking process

                  Graphics are applied to the shirt using a process called "heat
                  transfer toner" which utilizes a toner printer with modified
                  toner, as well as a specialized carrier sheet. The carrier
                  sheet with the toner is then pressed at high temperature and
                  pressureto another specialized sheet that contains the
                  adhesive. Once that process takes place and the sheets are
                  separated, the original carrier sheet contains the adhesive
                  and toner combined. This post-processed sheet is now situated
                  on the garment and pressed in te same fashion as the previous
                  step (high high and pressure).
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The final step involves a third press with even higher
                  pressure and this is where we have te option to apply one of
                  three different finishing mats which will help seal the ink
                  into the garment while giving more of a matte look versus a
                  more glossy finish.
